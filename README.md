### Magic 8 Ball

This App was done with help from a Udemy tutorial. It is pretty simple and basic, but helped build the foundation needed for iOS development. 

As you can see there is a home screen icon and once the application is open they see the main screen. It is simple, the user thinks of a question then clicks the button. Randomly a reply will be seen in the image like a "real" Magic 8 Ball!
