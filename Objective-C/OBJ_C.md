## Hello

These files are basic console programs that use various concepts that I have learned.


### Gender Reveal

This program was a simple exercise. The prompt for this exercise was to create a program that asks the user to input their gender "m" or "f". I used || to help capture the input for the user. For this program either lower or upper case letters would work.
