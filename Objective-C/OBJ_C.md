## Hello

These files are basic console programs that use various concepts that I have learned that range from simple string/data manipulation up to working with classes and such. A lot of good fundamental practice to help solidify the basics. 

# Basics

### Gender Reveal

This program was a simple exercise. The prompt for this exercise was to create a program that asks the user to input their gender "m" or "f". I used || to help capture the input for the user. For this program either lower or upper case letters would work. 

As you can see in the results the program is really straight to the point. Once the user presses enter they are met with either "you are a boy" for 'm' || 'M' and "you are a girl" for  'f' || 'F'.

### ErrorFix

This program was a fun challenge. I was given said code and had to debug it to get it to work properly. Was a little trial and error but finally I got it. Learning in action!

# Arrays

### ArrayFun
This program is very simple and was the first look at working with arrays using Objective-C.

# Classes

### Business Information

This program is a simple one that incorporates the use of `@interface` and `@implementation` files.
