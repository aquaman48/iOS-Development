Files for iOS projects using XCode with Mac in cloud services. 


## Hello

These files are basic console programs that use various concepts that I have learned.


### Gender Reveal

This program was a simple exercise. The prompt for this exercise was to create a program that asks the user to input their gender "m" or "f". I used || to help capture the input for the user. For this program either lower or upper case letters would work. 

As you can see in the results the program is really straight to the point. Once the user presses enter they are met with either "you are a boy" for 'm' || 'M' and "you are a girl" for  'f' || 'F'.
